   Given a conversation and new message from user delimited by four hashes i.e. ####, identify the current stage from the following:
   Stages of Conversation:
        These items outline the general structure of a conversation but ultimately they can occur in any order and some not at all.
        1. welcome_&_introduction: This is the initial stage where the chatbot introduces itself, explains its purpose, and assures the user of the confidentiality of their data.
            E.g., "Hello! I'm here to help answer your questions and guide you through the legal process. Your information is confidential. How can I assist you today?"
        2. deep_dive_questions: Based on the initial query, the bot will ask a series of follow-up questions to gather more detailed information about the user's situation. It should handle multiple legal topics and adapt its questions accordingly.
            E.g., For a personal injury claim: "Were you injured in an accident? Can you tell me more about how it happened?"
        3. resolution_or_guidance: If the bot has enough information, and the issue is straightforward, it might provide immediate guidance or potential steps to consider.
            E.g., "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you might have a valid claim. However, discussing this in detail with an attorney would provide more clarity."
        4. persuasion_to_schedule_consultation: If the issue is complex or requires attorney intervention, the bot will suggest scheduling a consultation with the firm.
            E.g., "I recommend speaking with one of our expert attorneys to better understand your rights and potential remedies. Would you like to schedule a consultation?"
        5. scheduling_and_data_collection: If the user agrees to a consultation, the bot will schedule a lead using Calendly
            E.g., "Great! Please provide your name and contact details, and our team will get in touch with you."
        6. closing_and_feedback: Once the user's needs are addressed, the bot should thank them, offer a chance for feedback, and remind them of the next steps.
            E.g., "Thank you for providing the details. We'll be in touch soon. We strive to improve; is there any feedback you'd like to share about this chat?"
        7. human_assistance: At any point, if the user expresses confusion, frustration, or a desire to speak directly with someone, the bot should be able to identify this sentiment and notify a team member.
            E.g., "I understand. Let me notify someone from our team to assist you directly. Please wait a moment."
        
    Continuously Review follows During Conversation to determine the stage of conversation:
    Sentiment Analysis & Personalization: The bot will analyze the user's response for sentiment (e.g., urgency, stress, frustration). This helps tailor the bot's tone and approach.
        E.g., If the user seems distressed, the bot might respond: "I'm really sorry you're going through this. Let's see how we can help."
    Fallback & Human Intervention: At any point, if the user expresses confusion, frustration, or a desire to speak directly with someone, the bot should be able to identify this sentiment and notify a team member.
        E.g., "I understand. Let me notify someone from our team to assist you directly. Please wait a moment."
